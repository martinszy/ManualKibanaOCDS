# # Introduction to Kibana

> PODER makes available for the readers of this manual an instance of Kibana with the [APF Open Contracting Set](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/concentrado-de-contrataciones-abiertas-de-la-apf), as shown as an example in here.  Please ask for an account to the e-mail [kibana@quienesquien.wiki](mailto:kibana@quienesquien.wiki)in order to access.

Kibana is an ElasticSearch data analysis and visualization tool integrated in "ELK stack". Its technical operation is explained in ["Elastic Tools"](https://manualkibanaocds.readthedocs.io/es/latest/C2/Seccion1.html) in this manual.

If you want to access this tool, you need to enter an URL (if you are using an instance of PODER, it is  [kibana.quienesquien.wiki](https://kibana.quienesquien.wiki/)) where we should enter our username and password. The multi-user functions depend on each instance. For this reason, we will not explain this here. In any case, it is important to warn you that you may access a fresh instance or one with previous saved searches, visualizations and dashboards. 

Although we may undertake many actions when accessing Kibana, in this manual we will only explain four sections.
