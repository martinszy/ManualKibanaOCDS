# Dashboard creation

As we have saved a set of graphs that are useful to analyze and with a constant data input source, the dashboard enables us to create control panels to monitor the data entry. It has a very simple configuration. We only need to press the «Add» button, select the graphics and/or saved searches and everything will be displayed on the board (which we can configure as we like).

Moreover, we have an option to choose the time (as displayed in the image) and we can quickly choose the time interval we are interested in.
